                <p>Well, since I was born, I was always with dogs. They are loyal, and inclediblly cute. I believe that there is no one who likes dogs more than me. I have one dachshund, her name is Moka. She is the most precious creature in the entire world. But she is too cute to put on my website so I chose some random dachshund's picture.</br>
