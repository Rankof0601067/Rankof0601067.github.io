                <p>So, I am THE Ranko Tanaka. 
                Tokyo loves me so I was born in there, but the States loves me as well so I went there. But then, Taiwan told me he couldn't forget me so I am here now. I don't eat any meat stuff but I am so happy.
                There is no need to worry, I eat tofu instead. </br>

                <p2>Also, speaking of my favorite things, I like chick these days. I have many stuffed chicks and one chicken(the already grew up one). In addition, french fries is something I cannot live without. You can call me professional french fries eater.
